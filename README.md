# Optical-Character-Reader


Optical Character Recognition(OCR) has been a popular task in Computer Vision. Tesseract is the most open-source software available for OCR. It was initially developed by HP as a tool in C++. 
Since 2006 it is developed by Google. The original software is available as a command-line tool for windows. We are living in a python world. Because of its popularity,the tool is also available in python--developed and maintained as an opensource project.

> 1.1 Whatis computer vision?

> As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional Structure of the world around us with apparent
case. Think of how vivid the three-dimensional percept is when you look at a vase of flowers
sitting on the table next to you. You can tell the shape and translucency of each petal through
the subtle patterns of light and shading that play across its surface and effortlessly segment
each flower from the background of the scene (Figure 1.1). Looking at a framed group por-
trait, you can easily count (and name) all of the people in the picture and even guess at their
emotions from their facial appearance. Perceptual psychologists have spent decades trying to
understand how the visual system works and, even though they can devise optical illusions!
to tease apart some of its principles (Figure 1.3), a complete solution to this puzzle remains
elusive (Marr 1982; Palmer 1999; Livingstone 2008).
